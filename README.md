## polypbren


Polypbren is a program that computes the renormalized parameters (renormalized charges and screening length) for dispersions of
charged spherical particles with arbitrary size distributions. The surface charge of the colloids can be fixed or regulated by pH.
The Poisson-Boltzmann Cell Model and Renormalized Jellium Model are implemented. 

It can be built and installed via [nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble), 
the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) package manager
(see [installation instructions](https://nim-lang.org/install.html):
```
nimble install https://github.com/guibar64/polypbren.git
```
